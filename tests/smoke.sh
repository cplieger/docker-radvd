# Build-time smoke test for docker-radvd.
#
# Runs in the Dockerfile `test` stage, so the centralized `ci / validate`
# docker build-ability gate executes it on every PR and push (the final image
# stage depends on this stage's marker). Catches a broken radvd build and
# validates that radvd's config parser accepts a good config and rejects a
# malformed one — the real failure modes for a thin upstream-wrapper image.
#
# Run locally:  sh tests/smoke.sh   (needs the radvd binary on PATH)

# 3. Version assertion: the built binary reports exactly the pinned upstream

#    skips it; the Dockerfile guards the ARG with :? so the in-image gate can
#    never silently skip. radvd's version flag prints to stderr and exits
#    non-zero by design, so only the output is asserted. The version line is
#    compared EXACTLY (not as a substring): a prefix match would accept
#    2.21.1 or 2.210 for an expected 2.21, hiding a fetch/extract mixup.
